# Big-Data-MNIST-dataset

# Exercise
Refer to the classification-clothing.ipynb. In this notebook, we worked with FashionMNIST dataset and developed a model. The predictions (on TPU) were made with a confidence score. In this exercise we will play around and mimic the results for MNIST digit handwriting dataset. 

As a final step we will generate a graph of predictions along with their confidence score as shown below. 

### Task 1 : First 15 predictions showing the image and the histogram

### Task 2 :  The first 15 bad predictions again with the image and the histogram

### Task 3. The first 15 bad predictions shown as in Ch12.ipynb notebook
